1.  Introduction

   [RFC8253] defines how to protect PCEP messages [RFC5440] with TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246].  This document describes defines how to protect PCEP
   messages with TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   This document addresses cipher suites and the use of early data,
   which is also known as 0-RTT data.  All other provisions set forth in
   [RFC8253] are unchanged, including connection initiation, message
   framing, connection closure, certificate validation, peer identity,
   and failure handling.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Early Data

   Early data (aka 0-RTT data) is a mechanism defined in TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis] that allows a client to send data ("early
   data") as part of the first flight of messages to a server.  Early
   data is permitted by TLS 1.3 when the client and server share a Pre-
   Shared Key (PSK), either obtained externally or via a previous
   handshake.  The client uses the PSK to authenticate the server and to
   encrypt the early data.

   As noted in Section 2.3 of [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis], the security
   properties for early data are weaker than those for subsequent TLS-
   protected data.  In particular, early data is not forward secret, and
   there are no protection against the replay of early data between
   connections.  Appendix E.5 of [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis] requires
   applicaitons not use early data without a profile that defines its
   use.  This document specifies that PCEPS implementations MUST NOT use
   early data.

4.  Cipher Suites

   Implementations MUST support TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis], and
   implementation are REQUIRED to support the mandatory-to-implement
   cipher suites listed in Section 9.1 of [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   Implementations MAY implement additional TLS cipher suites that
   provide mutual authentication and confidentiality, which are required
   for PCEP.

   Implementations SHOULD follow the recommendations given in
   [I-D.ietf-uta-rfc7525bis].

 So, this is what {{Section 9.1 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}} says:

   A TLS-compliant application MUST implement the TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   [GCM] cipher suite and SHOULD implement the TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   [GCM] and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 [RFC8439] cipher suites (see
   Appendix B.4).

   A TLS-compliant application MUST support digital signatures with
   rsa_pkcs1_sha256 (for certificates), rsa_pss_rsae_sha256 (for
   CertificateVerify and certificates), and ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256.  A
   TLS-compliant application MUST support key exchange with secp256r1
   (NIST P-256) and SHOULD support key exchange with X25519 [RFC7748].

 Is there any reason to narrow the algorithm choices?

 My guess is not.  These ought to be available in all TLS libraries.

5.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations in TLS 1.3 are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   The recommendations regarding Diffie-Hellman exponent reuse are
   specified in Section 7.4 of [I-D.ietf-uta-rfc7525bis].

   The key Security Considerations for PCEP are described in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], [RFC8281], and [RFC8283].

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.  PCEP is the communication protocol between a PCC and PCE
   and is defined in [RFC5440].  Stateful PCE [RFC8231] specifies a set
   of extensions to PCEP to enable control of TE-LSPs by a PCE that
   retains the state of the LSPs provisioned in the network (a stateful
   PCE).  [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance, and teardown of
   LSPs initiated by a stateful PCE without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network that is
   centrally controlled.  [RFC8283] introduces the architecture for PCE
   as a central controller

   TLS 1.3 mutual authentication is used to ensure that only authorized
   users and systems are able to send and receive PCEP messages.  To
   this end, neither the PCC nor the PCE should establish a PCEPS with
   TLS 1.3 connection with an unknown, unexpected, or incorrect peer
   identity; see Section 3.5 of [RFC5440].  If deployments make use of
   this list of Certification Authority (CA) certificates [RFC5280],
   then the listed CAs should only issue certificates to parties that
   are authorized to access the PCE.  Doing otherwise will allow
   certificates that were issued for other purposes to be
   inappropriately accepted by a PCE.

   The recommendations regarding certificate revocation checking are
   specified in Section 7.5 of [I-D.ietf-uta-rfc7525bis].

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
